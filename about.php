                                        <p>One of the most important criteria for choosing the venue is good connectivity. Located in the heart of Bangalore city, it is hardly at a distance of 25mins from the hub areas of Bangalore like M.G. road, Majestic and Hebbal. It takes less than an hour from the Airport and a mere 20mins drive from the city station. It also connects to some of the most luxurious hotels like Shangri-La, The Lalit-Ashok and ITC Windsor where you can accommodate your privileged guests. On the other hand, affordable accommodation is just down the lane in hotels like The Solitaire, Bangalore International, Radisson Blue or service apartments like Chevron Orchards, The Orchards Suites, Treebo Orchard Suites or Atlaantic Inn.</p>
